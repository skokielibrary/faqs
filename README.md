#FAQ site styles

These are custom styles for our BOOMBox faq site. The site uses [Libraryh3lp's](https://us.libraryh3lp.com/) FAQ site builder.

## Getting started

We use SASS to manage the CSS and Gulp to file the final CSS file.

```
git clone [this repo]
npm install
gulp
```

The final command runs the defaul gulp tasks which takes the files from the `scss` directory, combines them, minifies them, and puts them in the `css` directory.
